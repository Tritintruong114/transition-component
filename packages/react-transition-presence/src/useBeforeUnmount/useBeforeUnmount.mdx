# useBeforeUnmount

The `useBeforeUnmount` hook accepts a function that will be called before the component is
unmounted. The callback function is awaited, it defers the unmounting of the component until the
function is resolved.

> A common use case for the `useBeforeUnmount` hook is to create an out transition that defers the
> unmounting of the component until the transition is complete.
