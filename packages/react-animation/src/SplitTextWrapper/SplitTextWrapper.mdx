# SplitTextWrapper

The SplitTextWrapper creates a SplitText instance that can be retrieved using a ref. The SplitText
is available as soon as the just before the components is finished mounting. A new SplitText
instance is created when the children or variables change.

## Example

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Example" />
</Canvas>

## Usage

The SplitTextWrapper accepts 1 child, this child is rendered to HTML inside the component to make
sure that compnents from the vDOM are not changed on render making them untargetable in the created
SplitText instance.

<Source name="Example" dark language="tsx" />
